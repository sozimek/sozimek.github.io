Did you ever wish that reaching five-nines availability, deploying across multiple data centers and availability zones, and pushing updates to hundreds of endpoints was a simple as writing a few lines of code?

Good news.

XL Release and XL Deploy are here.

## What is DevOps as code?
At XebiaLabs, we believe that developers shouldn't have to waste their time fiddling with deployments. As coders ourselves, we always wanted deployments and releases to be simple: write code, push it to a repository, and apply it as a part of our CI pipeline. This is why we built XL Release and XL Deploy - two tools that let you automate DevOps as you would anything else. Just define your:
* deployment package,
* infrastructure,
* enviroment,
* release template,
* dashboard,
* and anything else you want
as a YAML file and store it in the same repo where you keep your application code. Time to deploy? Just run a bash script from your terminal.
