## My ideas for developer.xebialabs.com

The purpose of the page is twofold: first, to attract developers to the XL platform and show them that they will enjoy working with this technology and second, to provide developers with the information they need to actually use it in production.

Winning over developers is about building credibility. The page should be simple and modern, with a minimal aesthetic. I like the approach that [crate.io](https://crate.io/docs/) took. On their initial documentation page, they offer a quickstart guide that lets people quickly get their hands on the technology. At the same time, it's easy to find the full reference for all the advanced functionalities.

It's also a good idea to show as many real-life examples as possible, especially with regards to integrations. This boosts credibility and makes developers happy - they can easily learn how to get the XL platform to work with the stack they already use at their company.

I also think that adding some interactivity to the page would be beneficial. Instead of providing static lists of commands, we could consider using something like [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) to record terminal sessions and embed them into the content. Additionally, providing something like the [Docker playground](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/), where devs can play with the technology live, would give potential users a chance to get their feet wet without having to install anything on their machine.

Following the interactive approach also has the benefit of potentially attracting more traffic through tech news aggregators, like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) or [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs). While the chances of anyone sharing a run-of-the-mill documentation page are low, an interactive playground can garner some real interest from people.

To summarize, the key things we should concentrate on when building the page are:

 - modern aesthetic,
 - quickstart guide first, full reference second,
 - terminal session recordings rather than static commands,
 - interactive playground for the XL platform.
